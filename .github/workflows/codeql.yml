# CodeQL Code Scanning
#
# This workflow runs CodeQL analysis for security vulnerability detection.
# Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning
#
# Why these triggers?
# - push (main): Establishes a baseline of results on the default branch. This baseline
#   is used to compare against PR results to show only NEW alerts introduced by the PR.
# - pull_request: Scans PR code and shows alerts as annotations on the PR.
# - schedule: Weekly scan catches newly discovered vulnerabilities in dependencies
#   even when the code isn't actively being changed.
#
# Without the push trigger on main, PRs would show ALL alerts (not just new ones),
# and the branch protection rule requiring CodeQL results would fail.
