# archestra_user (Data Source)

Fetches an Archestra user by ID.

**⚠️ Backend API Limitation**: This data source is currently blocked because the backend does not expose user lookup endpoints in a way that can be code-generated (user endpoints are exposed as a catch-all route /api/auth/*, which makes codegen impossible). The schema is defined and ready, but read operations will fail with a clear error message until the backend APIs are properly exposed.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Look up a user by ID
# Note: This data source requires backend API support for user queries
data "archestra_user" "example" {
  id = "user-123"
}

# Output user information
output "user_email" {
  value = data.archestra_user.example.email
}

output "user_role" {
  value = data.archestra_user.example.role
}
```
